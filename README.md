# My_Thesis:
**Self-driving car using CNN + YOLOv4-tiny + TensorRT on Jetson nano kit**

## Description : 
- This is my Thesis. Our team(2 members) researched and applied CNN and YOLOv4-tiny algorithms + TensorRT for steering angle prediction and object detection (traffic sign) for self-driving car .
- Hardware:  Jetson Nano kit, Stm32f4,..
- The dataset is collected and labeled by team members.
- Result : 9.17/10
